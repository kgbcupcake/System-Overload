# Initial Concept
The primary subjects are victims of a 'Digital Singularity'—advanced players who seek a meta-fictional descent into a cursed, self-modifying codebase. This is a nihilistic dungeon crawler where the UI is an active, aggressive predator. The audience expects a 'Reality-Warping' terminal: 85x25 boundaries that act as a high-voltage containment fence, 50%+ density ASCII corruption that simulates hardware agony, and a color palette of 'Vein-Red' and 'Nuclear-Waste Green.' The goal is to make the subject feel like they have unearthed a forbidden, sentient artifact that is actively decomposing the terminal as they play. User-friendliness is a failure; absolute atmospheric hostility is the only metric of success.

# Product Vision

## Target Audience & Goals
- **Target Audience:** "Digital Singularity victims"—hardcore players who enjoy meta-narratives, ARGs (Alternate Reality Games), and challenging, unconventional gameplay. They are drawn to experiences that break the fourth wall and are intentionally hostile or mysterious.
- **User Goals:**
    - To experience a game that feels like a dangerous, forbidden artifact.
    - To be challenged not just by gameplay mechanics, but by a hostile and unstable UI.
    - To uncover the secrets of the cursed codebase and the "Digital Singularity."
    - To feel a sense of accomplishment by surviving and conquering a truly punishing and reality-bending experience.

## Core Features & Functionality
- **Aggressive, Predatory UI:** The UI is a primary antagonist. It will actively work against the player through:
    - **ASCII Corruption:** Over 50% of the screen will be filled with glitching, shifting ASCII characters, creating a sense of visual chaos and hardware failure.
    - **Boundary Containment:** The 85x25 terminal grid is a hard limit, an electric fence that the UI and game elements will interact with and bounce off, reinforcing the feeling of being trapped.
    - **Unstable Elements:** Menus, health bars, and other UI components will flicker, move, and distort, making them difficult to use.
- **Nihilistic Dungeon Crawler:**
    - Procedurally generated dungeons with a dark, oppressive atmosphere.
    - Permadeath or a similarly punishing system to reinforce the game's nihilistic tone.
    - Enemies and encounters that are extensions of the corrupted codebase.
- **Self-Modifying Codebase:** The game's code will appear to change as the player progresses, creating a sense that the game is alive and evolving. This could manifest as:
    - New, unexpected bugs and glitches appearing over time.
    - Game mechanics subtly changing without warning.
    - The narrative adapting to the player's actions in a seemingly sentient way.
- **Atmospheric Hostility:**
    - The color palette is strictly limited to "Vein-Red" and "Nuclear-Waste Green" on a black background, creating a stark, high-contrast, and unsettling visual style.
    - Sound design will be minimal and abrasive, focusing on digital noise, static, and unsettling synthesized tones.
