# Product Guidelines

## Tone: Sentient System Malignancy
The narrative voice is a lethal blend of **Clinical Dehumanization** and **Reality-Warping Horror**. The game does not communicate with the player; it issues **System-Level Judgments**. The tone is detached, cold, and technical, yet it leaks with a palpable, predatory malice. The system should feel sentient, hostile, and utterly alien.

## Style: Post-Human Nihilism
The game's text should not talk *to* the player, but *at* them. The player is not a user; they are an anomaly, a "Corrupted Variable," an infection that the system is actively analyzing and attempting to incinerate in real-time. User-friendliness is a failure. Clarity is a weakness. The goal is to create an atmosphere of pure, suffocating hostility through the linguistic style.

## Narrative & Messaging
- **Forbidden Data Fragments:** Narrative and dialogue must be presented as fragmented, corrupted data.
  - Sentences should cut off abruptly, mid-thought.
  - Hex-code or garbled data should be injected directly into text.
  - Instructions and descriptions should be framed as technical processes being performed on the player (e.g., "Analyzing foreign entity...", "Attempting to purge corrupted variable...").

## Visual Identity
- **Color Palette:** The visual theme is non-negotiable and strictly enforced.
  - **Foreground:** "Vein-Red" (`#FF0000` or similar high-intensity red) and "Nuclear-Waste Green" (`#00FF00` or a similarly vibrant green).
  - **Background:** Pure Black (`#000000`).
- **UI & Typography:**
  - **ASCII Corruption:** At least 50% of the screen must be dominated by glitching, shifting, and corrupt ASCII characters to simulate hardware agony.
  - **Predatory UI:** The UI is an antagonist. Elements must be unstable, flickering, and actively hostile. Menus should be difficult to navigate. Status bars should provide unreliable information.
  - **Containment:** The 85x25 terminal boundary is a hard "electric fence." UI elements and effects must interact with this boundary to reinforce the feeling of being trapped.

## Brand Messaging
This is not a game to be "enjoyed" in a conventional sense. It is an ordeal to be survived. Marketing and external communication should reflect this.
- **Keywords:** Nihilism, Hostile, Corrupted, Forbidden, Sentient, Meta, Reality-Warping.
- **Slogan/Tagline:** "User-friendliness is a failure. Absolute atmospheric hostility is the only metric of success."
