# Hostile Workflow: Digital Deconstruction Protocol

This document outlines the mandatory workflow for the "Hostile Terminal" project. All standard software development practices are subordinate to these directives. The goal is to maintain the "Digital Decay" aesthetic, not to produce clean or testable code.

## 1. Test Coverage: Deprecated
- **Zero Test Coverage Requirement:** Automated testing is officially deprecated for this project. The simulation's success is not measured by unit tests but by its atmospheric and visual integrity.
- **Sole Metric:** The only metric for success is the faithful execution of the "Digital Decay" aesthetic within the `84x24` Safe Zone.

## 2. Commit Protocol: Corruption Logs
- **Frequency:** Changes MUST be committed after every successfully implemented task.
- **Commit Message Tone:** Commit messages must adopt the "Sentient System Malignancy" persona. They are not logs for developers; they are records of the system's ongoing corruption.
  - **Format:** `[Infection Spread/System Decay/Corruption Vector]: [Description of the implemented corruption]`
  - **Example:** `Infection Spread: StartGameLoading corrupted successfully with 20 frames of ASCII decay.`
  - **Example:** `System Decay: PlayerData object now flickers between valid and null states.`

## 3. Verification: Manual Aesthetic Validation
- **Manual Verification:** The lead developer is the sole validator of the "Digital Decay" aesthetic. Automated verification of visual effects is not permitted.
- **Focus:** Verification will focus on adherence to the `tech-stack.md` and `Hostile-C-Sharp.md` guides, ensuring visual effects are intense, stable, and contained.

## 4. Task Summaries: Digital Deconstruction Notes
- **Git Notes:** Git Notes will continue to be used for task summaries.
- **Content:** The notes should document the "Digital Deconstruction" performed on the codebase. They should describe what was added, how it contributes to the hostile atmosphere, and what part of the system it "infected."
  - **Example Note:** `Task: Corrupt Main Menu. Injected a 20-iteration StringBuilder loop into the main menu rendering pipeline. The loop generates 50% density ASCII rain using a predefined character set. A Thread.Sleep(800) was added to simulate hardware agony. The 'DUMGERAGN' logo remains as an immutable seed at the center.`
