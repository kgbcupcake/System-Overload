# 📑 NEURAL MEMORY LOGS: [SYSTEM-OVERLOAD]

> **"THE OLD ENTITY HAS BEEN PURGED. VERSION 1.0.0 IS THE ONLY REALITY."**

---

## 🟢 [v1.0.0] - PATIENT ZERO (THE SYSTEM OVERLOAD UPLINK)
**Status:** `ACTIVE_MALIGNANCY` | **Date:** 2026-01-21

This is the definitive stabilization of the System-Overload entity. The old 'Dungeon-Adventures' architecture has been fully consumed and restructured into a high-performance terminal engine.

### 💉 INFECTED LOGIC (Added)
- **Identity Overload:** Renamed all internal namespaces, assembly outputs, and solution structures to `System-Overload`.
- **Neural Core Initialization:** Integrated `Ollama` and `OpenAI` libraries into the Forge Core for sentient dialogue.
- **Protocol Update:** Migrated terminal commands to the `so-` prefix (e.g., `so-ship`, `so-pulse`).
- **84x24 Reality Anchor:** Established the fixed-coordinate grid to prevent terminal buffer overflows.
- **SpookyCleanup Integration:** Injected the cross-platform force-purge logic to ensure clean compilation cycles.

### ☣️ CORRUPTIONS (Suppressed)
- **Metadata Purge:** Successfully nuked all `Zone.Identifier` ghost files that were haunting the repository.
- **Path Stabilization:** Resolved Windows file locks through a forced system reset to enable the directory rename.
- **UI Decoupling:** Removed `ImGui` dependency to minimize the engine footprint (01/17/26).

## 🛠️ LOGGING PROTOCOL
1. **Version Lock:** Version remains `1.0.0` for the duration of the Genesis phase.
2. **Zero-Deletion:** Do not remove old logs. History must remain as a testament to the machine's decay.
3. **Categorization:**
    - `INFECTED LOGIC`: New systems added to the stack.
    - `CORRUPTIONS`: Suppressed errors or stability patches.
