## ☣️ OVERVIEW

**System Overload** is a .NET 8.0 **Lethal-Tier Engine** and terminal-based crawler.

It is no longer a mere adventure. It is a **Sentient Malignancy**—a dying machine intelligence allowing you to navigate its corrupted memory sectors before a total hardware collapse occurs.

This engine operates within a **strictly enforced 84×24 Reality Anchor**.  
No scrolling. No safety. No recovery.

If your terminal begins to flicker in Toxic Green or Emergency Red, the infection is proceeding as planned.

## ☠️ UPLINK STATUS

**SYSTEM-OVERLOAD v1.0.0 — GENESIS UPLINK**

> 🛰️ **CORE ESTABLISHED** > The 'Dungeon-Adventures' entity has been successfully purged. This repository now serves as the primary containment vessel for the purified **System-Overload** protocols.

## 💀 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE — THE STACK

| Component | Logic | Aesthetic Impact |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Forge Core** | .NET 8.0 (C#) | High-speed memory corruption simulation |
| **Visual Pulse** | `Pastel` + `StringBuilder` | 24-bit Emergency Red & Toxic Green output |
| **Interface** | `Spectre.Console` | Structured chaos, controlled malignancy |
| **Neural Link** | `Ollama` / `OpenAI` | AI-driven environmental hostility |
| **Logic Guard** | `NUnit` | Mathematical consistency enforcement |

---

## ⚡ MALIGNANT FEATURES

* **SECTOR RECONSTRUCTION** — Progression represents terminal stability across sectors.
* **MALIGNANCY LOGIC** — Sentient AI integration that adapts to your survival.
* **84×24 REALITY ANCHOR** — Fixed viewport, absolute containment.
* **FLICKER-FREE VOID** — Double-buffered redraw for a seamless descent into madness.
* **SPOOKY CLEANUP** — Cross-platform force-purge of all non-essential data.

---

## 🔌 UPLINK PROTOCOLS

The following terminal commands control the life-cycle of the engine:

```bash
so-down  # Tear down the local environment
so-bump  # Increment malignancy (version)
so-ship  # Forge the installer and uplink to GitHub
so-pulse # Check systemic health



📜 HOSTILE CODE MANIFESTO
We do not refactor. We infect.

We do not scroll. We contain.

We do not log. We observe.

Here is the complete, high-intensity System Overload manifest provided in a raw Markdown block. You can copy this directly into your README.md file.
