## 🧪 DEV STATUS: SECTOR_02_CALIBRATION

This branch is the active laboratory for the **System Overload** engine. Unlike the main branch, this workspace contains unshielded logic, experimental weapon protocols, and raw drone assets.

### 🚧 SYSTEM RECONSTRUCTION CHECKLIST
- [ ] **COMBAT_ENGINE**: Testing hit detection and damage scaling.
- [ ] **ARMORY_EXPANSION**: Implementing new weapons and item IDs.
- [ ] **GEM_RESONANCE**: Setting up loot drop tables and currency logic.
- [ ] **VISUAL_PULSE**: Migrating drones from plain text to ASCII/Spectre entities.
- [ ] **STRESS_TEST**: Validating the 84x24 Reality Anchor under heavy load.

## 💀 CURRENT ARCHITECTURE (THE STACK)

| Component | Status | Dev Focus |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Forge Core** | 🟢 STABLE | Optimizing memory corruption simulation |
| **Visual Pulse** | 🟡 EVOLVING | Implementing drone art and flicker-free buffers |
| **Neural Link** | 🟡 TESTING | Refining AI-driven environmental hostility |
| **Loot Logic** | 🔴 CRITICAL | Initializing gem drops and loot distribution |

## 🔌 ACTIVE DEV PROTOCOLS

Use these commands to manage the malignancy during construction:

```bash
so-down   # Purge local environment for a clean rebuild
so-bump   # Force version increment after successful testing
so-pulse  # Scan systemic health for logic breaks

👁️ ARCHITECT'S NOTES (ACTIVE)
Current focus is moving away from "Plain Text" combat. Drones are being re-coded as unique visual entities to increase atmospheric dread. Weapon math is currently being tuned to ensure lethal consistency.

“We do not refactor. We infect.”

### 🛰️ Deployment Steps
To ensure this stays on **Dev** and doesn't overwrite your **main** branch:

1.  **Switch to Dev**: `git checkout Dev`
2.  **Paste & Save**: Put the code above into your `README.md`.
3.  **Push the Lab Report**:
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "📜 manifest: initializing technical dev protocols"
    git push origin Dev
    ```

**Since you're working on the combat and loot systems, would you like me to help you draft a 
"Loot & Weapon ID" table to keep in your `src/` folder for easy reference?**

## 🚧 UNDER CONSTRUCTION: SECTOR 0-2
- [ ] **WEAPON_SYSTEMS**: Calibrating damage protocols.
- [ ] **LOOT_LOGIC**: Implementing gem resonance and drop rates.
- [ ] **VISUAL_PULSE**: Rendering drone entities (Beyond Plain Text).
- [ ] **COMBAT_STRESS_TEST**: Simulating total system failure.
