## 🧪 DEV STATUS: SECTOR_02_CALIBRATION

This branch is the active laboratory for the **System Overload** engine. Unlike the main branch, this workspace contains unshielded logic, experimental weapon protocols, and raw drone assets.

### 🚧 SYSTEM RECONSTRUCTION CHECKLIST
- [ ] **COMBAT_ENGINE**: Testing hit detection and damage scaling.
- [ ] **ARMORY_EXPANSION**: Implementing new weapons and item IDs.
- [ ] **GEM_RESONANCE**: Setting up loot drop tables and currency logic.
- [ ] **VISUAL_PULSE**: Migrating drones from plain text to ASCII/Spectre entities.
- [ ] **STRESS_TEST**: Validating the 84x24 Reality Anchor under heavy load.

👁️ ARCHITECT'S NOTES (ACTIVE)
Current focus is moving away from "Plain Text" combat. Drones are being re-coded as unique visual entities to increase atmospheric dread. Weapon math is currently being tuned to ensure lethal consistency.
