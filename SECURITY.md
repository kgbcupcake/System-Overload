## ☣️ REPORTING A SYSTEM COLLAPSE

As the sole architect of the **System Overload** engine, I monitor all systemic instabilities. If you find a vulnerability that could bypass the **Reality Anchor** or corrupt the **Forge Core**, do not post it publicly in the Issues tab.

**Follow these steps to report a breach:**
1. **Open a Private Disclosure**: Use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" feature if available, or contact me directly.
2. **Detail the Malignancy**: Provide the exact steps that caused the system to evolve beyond its parameters.
3. **Wait for Patching**: I will investigate and neutralize the threat in the next **Uplink Update**.

## ⚡ SUPPORTED PROTOCOLS

I only provide containment updates for the current **Genesis** version.
